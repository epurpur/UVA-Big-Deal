<p>UVA Big Deal - 1Figr Data Progress Report (June 27, 2019)</p>
<p>This week was fun for me.<br>
So far, we’ve been following Brandon’s document and exploring the idea of “fluff”. One of our assumptions is that many providers, especially the big 5 providers of Elsevier, Taylor &amp; Francis, Sage, Springer, Wiley pad their offerings with “fluff”, or basically journals that the UVA community is not using. But first a quick aside.</p>
<p>I added some colors to an existing graph to make it more readable. Here is the comparison chart by provider, showing the ratio of JR5 downloads to JR1 downloads. This is a measure to see how “current” a provider is. Jeremy Garritano grouped the providers into several categories to see if there was a trend between Publishers, Aggregators, Hybrids, or Archives. At this point we are trying this to see if any anomalies in the data really jump out at us:<br>

<p>Back to the “fluff”.<br>
We arrived at the thought that about 20% of the content is used in a provider while 80% is not used and just a few journals provided by each provider provides the majority of use. My first attempt was to look at the providers one by one to determine if this was true. Some of the providers on this list provide a small number of journals and are a relatively digestible chunk to parse with human eyes, so I used them as test cases. Let’s take a look at the American Chemical Society (ACS) first. I first printed a list of each journal that ACS publishes, followed by use (# of JR1 downloads) for each journal. Then I added up all the JR1 downloads by journal to get a total number of downloads. I then listed the journals in descending order, by their JR1 downloads. I figured out what is 80% of the total number of downloads, then counted (from the top) the journals which added up to make 80% of the use. I got a list of the ‘highly used journals’ which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[('Journal of the American Chemical Society', 13188.0), ('The Journal of Organic Chemistry', 5783.0), ('Journal of Chemical Education', 5070.0), ('Analytical Chemistry', 4708.0), ('Inorganic Chemistry', 4638.0), ('The Journal of Physical Chemistry C', 3915.0), ('Nano Letters', 3150.0), ('Environmental Science &amp; Technology', 2997.0), ('Organometallics', 2746.0), ('Biochemistry', 2642.0), ('Chemical Reviews', 2399.0), ('ACS Nano', 2354.0), ('ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces', 2330.0), ('ACS Catalysis', 2097.0), ('Organic Letters', 1997.0), ('Chemistry of Materials', 1863.0), ('Langmuir - The ACS Journal of Surfaces and Colloids', 1795.0), ('Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research', 1687.0), ('Macromolecules', 1501.0)]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see here, this list is of each journal title, with a # of JR1 downloads for each journal. Next I printed some statistics for each provider, which factors in these ‘highly used journals’ and their JR1 downloads. Take a look at the results, then I’ll explain:</p>
<pre><code>Total JR1 downloads for provider: American Chemical Society = 82379.0
19 of 49 journals make up 80% of the use
Fluff score = 0.3877551020408163
</code></pre>
<p>So as you can see here, the total # of JR1 downloads is 82379 for the ACS journals. Of 49 total publications, 19 of them make up 80% of the use of the collection. This leaves a ‘fluff score’ of .3877… . This actually should be reversed because this ‘fluff score’ number is actually the HIGH use journals and the fluff is everything else.</p>
<p>I thought this was an interesting statistic, but instead of seeing it just for one provider at a time, let’s take a look at all providers. Here is the fluff score by provider for all providers, with the Big 5 providers in red. Again, keep in mind this fluff score is actually the inverse of what it should be… but you get the point.</p>

<p>I will let you interpret the results for yourself, but across the X axis on the bottom is the % fluff by provider. Notice at .2, this is the 80%/20% cutoff line we are focused on. Springer seems to be the fluffiest of the big 5 providers, as only 19% of its publications are “high use”.</p>
